# TrueNAS Plugin Changelog

## Version 1.1.1 (November 1, 2025)

### 🔧 **Transport Enhancements: NVMe/iSCSI Feature Parity**

Significant improvements to both NVMe/TCP and iSCSI transports, bringing NVMe to feature parity with the mature iSCSI implementation.

#### **NVMe/TCP Improvements**
- **Added subsystem validation to pre-flight checks** - Validates subsystem existence before allocation, providing early error detection similar to iSCSI target validation
- **Fixed resize rescan bug** - Corrected critical bug where NVMe resize used subsystem NQN instead of device path for `nvme ns-rescan` command
- **Implemented force-delete retry logic** - Mirrors iSCSI's disconnect/retry behavior for "in use" errors, with intelligent multi-disk operation protection
- **Enhanced device readiness validation** - Progressive backoff strategy with block device checks (not just symlink existence), automatic controller rescans, and detailed troubleshooting output
- **Improved error messages** - Added comprehensive 5-step diagnostic guides with specific commands for troubleshooting device discovery failures

#### **iSCSI Improvements**
- **Added clone cleanup on failure** - Extent and target-extent mapping creation now properly clean up ZFS clone if operations fail, preventing orphaned resources

#### **Bug Fixes**
- Fixed NVMe resize using invalid NQN parameter for namespace rescan (now correctly uses controller device paths like `/dev/nvme3`)
- NVMe device validation now checks for actual block devices using `-b` flag, not just symlink existence
- Added proper progressive intervention during device wait (settle → rescan → trigger)

#### **Code Quality**
- Both transports now have equivalent robustness in error handling and retry logic
- Consistent cleanup patterns across clone operations in both iSCSI and NVMe
- Better multi-disk operation detection to avoid breaking concurrent tasks
- Enhanced logging with detailed operation context

## Version 1.1.0 (October 31, 2025)

### 🚀 **Major Feature: NVMe/TCP Transport Support**

Added native NVMe over TCP (NVMe/TCP) as an alternative transport mode to traditional iSCSI, providing significantly lower latency and reduced CPU overhead for modern infrastructures.

#### **Key Features**
- **Dual-transport architecture** - Choose between iSCSI (default, widely compatible) or NVMe/TCP (modern, high-performance)
- **Full lifecycle operations** - Complete support for volume create, delete, resize, list, clone, and snapshot operations
- **Native multipath** - NVMe/TCP native multipathing with multiple portal support
- **DH-HMAC-CHAP authentication** - Optional unidirectional or bidirectional authentication for secure connections
- **UUID-based device mapping** - Reliable device identification using `/dev/disk/by-id/nvme-uuid.*` paths
- **Automatic subsystem management** - Plugin creates and manages NVMe subsystems automatically via TrueNAS API

#### **Configuration**
New `transport_mode` parameter selects the storage protocol:
- `transport_mode iscsi` - Traditional iSCSI (default, backward compatible)
- `transport_mode nvme-tcp` - NVMe over TCP (requires TrueNAS SCALE 25.10+)

**NVMe/TCP-specific parameters:**
- `subsystem_nqn` - NVMe subsystem NQN (required, format: `nqn.YYYY-MM.domain:identifier`)
- `hostnqn` - NVMe host NQN (optional, auto-detected from `/etc/nvme/hostnqn`)
- `nvme_dhchap_secret` - Host authentication secret (optional DH-CHAP auth)
- `nvme_dhchap_ctrl_secret` - Controller authentication secret (optional bidirectional auth)

**Important notes:**
- `transport_mode` is **fixed** and cannot be changed after storage creation
- NVMe/TCP requires `api_transport ws` (WebSocket API transport)
- Different device naming: iSCSI uses `vol-<name>-lun<N>`, NVMe uses `vol-<name>-ns<UUID>`
- Default ports: iSCSI uses 3260, NVMe/TCP uses 4420

#### **Requirements**
- **TrueNAS**: SCALE 25.10.0 or later with NVMe-oF Target service enabled
- **Proxmox**: VE 9.x or later with `nvme-cli` package installed (`apt-get install nvme-cli`)
- **API Transport**: WebSocket required (`api_transport ws`) - REST API does not support NVMe operations

#### **Performance Characteristics**
Based on NVMe/TCP protocol advantages:
- **Lower latency**: 50-150μs vs iSCSI 200-500μs (typical)
- **Reduced CPU overhead**: No SCSI emulation layer
- **Better queue depth**: Native NVMe queuing (64K+ commands) vs iSCSI single queue
- **Native multipath**: Built-in multipathing without dm-multipath complexity

#### **📚 Documentation**
Comprehensive documentation added:
- **wiki/NVMe-Setup.md** - Complete setup guide with step-by-step TrueNAS and Proxmox configuration
- **wiki/Configuration.md** - Updated with NVMe/TCP parameter reference and examples
- **wiki/Troubleshooting.md** - Added NVMe-specific troubleshooting sections
- **storage.cfg.example** - Added NVMe/TCP configuration examples

#### **🔧 Technical Implementation**
- Lines 286-357: Configuration schema with transport mode and NVMe parameters
- Lines 540-598: Configuration validation with transport-specific checks
- Lines 2123-2424: NVMe helper functions (connection, device mapping, subsystem/namespace management)
- Lines 2782-2793: NVMe-specific volume allocation
- Lines 3084-3100: NVMe-specific volume deletion
- Lines 3298-3380: NVMe-specific volume listing

#### **Migration from iSCSI**
In-place migration is **not possible** due to:
- Volume naming format incompatibility (LUN numbers vs UUIDs)
- Device path differences (`/dev/disk/by-path/` vs `/dev/disk/by-id/nvme-uuid.*`)
- Transport mode marked as fixed in schema

**Migration path**: Create new NVMe storage with different storage ID, use `qm move-disk` to migrate VM disks individually.

#### **Validation and Testing**
- Verified on TrueNAS SCALE 25.10.0 with Proxmox VE 9.x
- Tested nvme-cli version 2.13 (git 2.13) with libnvme 1.13
- Validated DH-CHAP authentication (secret generation and configuration)
- Confirmed UUID-based device paths and multipath operation
- Verified all API endpoints (subsystem, namespace, port, host configuration)

## Version 1.0.8 (October 31, 2025)

### 🐛 **Bug Fix**
- **Fixed EFI VM creation with non-standard zvol blocksizes** - Plugin now automatically aligns volume sizes
  - **Error resolved**: "Volume size should be a multiple of volume block size"
  - **Issue**: EFI VMs require 528 KiB disks which don't align with common blocksizes (16K, 64K, 128K)
  - **Impact**: Users couldn't create UEFI/OVMF VMs when using custom `zvol_blocksize` configurations
  - **Affected operations**: Volume creation (`alloc_image`) for small disks like EFI variables

### 🔧 **Technical Details**
- Added `_parse_blocksize()` helper function (lines 91-105)
  - Converts blocksize strings (e.g., "128K", "64K") to bytes
  - Handles case-insensitive K/M/G suffixes
  - Returns 0 for invalid/undefined values
- Modified `alloc_image()` function (lines 2024-2038)
  - Automatically rounds up requested sizes to nearest blocksize multiple
  - Uses same modulo-based algorithm as existing `volume_resize()` function
  - Logs adjustments at info level: "alloc_image: size alignment: requested X bytes → aligned Y bytes"
- Maintains consistency with existing `volume_resize` alignment (lines 1307-1311)

### 📊 **Impact**
- **EFI/OVMF VM creation** - Now works seamlessly with any zvol blocksize configuration
- **Alignment is transparent** - No user intervention required, size adjustments logged automatically
- **No regression** - Standard disk sizes (1GB+) already aligned, no performance impact

### ✅ **Validation**
Tested with multiple blocksize configurations:
- 64K blocksize: 528 KiB → 576 KiB (aligned to 64K × 9)
- 128K blocksize: 528 KiB → 640 KiB (aligned to 128K × 5)

## Version 1.0.7 (October 23, 2025)

### 🐛 **Critical Bug Fix**
- **Fixed duplicate LUN mapping error** - Plugin now handles existing iSCSI configurations gracefully
  - **Error resolved**: "LUN ID is already being used for this target"
  - **Issue**: Plugin attempted to create duplicate target-extent mappings without checking for existing ones
  - **Impact**: Caused pvestatd crashes, prevented volume creation in environments with pre-existing iSCSI configs
  - **Affected operations**: Volume creation (`alloc_image`), volume cloning (`clone_image`), weight extent mapping
  - **Forum report**: https://forum.proxmox.com/threads/truenas-storage-plugin.174134/#post-810779

### 🔧 **Technical Details**
- Made all target-extent mapping operations **idempotent** (safe to call multiple times)
- Modified `alloc_image()` function (lines 2097-2130)
  - Now checks for existing mappings before attempting creation
  - Reuses existing mapping if found (with info logging)
  - Only creates new mapping when necessary
- Modified `clone_image()` function (lines 2973-3007)
  - Same idempotent logic applied to clone operations
  - Prevents duplicate mapping errors during VM cloning
- Enhanced `_tn_targetextent_create()` helper function (lines 1510-1531)
  - Returns existing mapping instead of attempting duplicate creation
  - Properly caches and invalidates mapping data
- Added debug logging for mapping creation decisions

### 📊 **Impact**
- **Environments with pre-existing iSCSI configurations** - No longer fail with validation errors
- **Systems with partial failed allocations** - Gracefully recover and reuse existing mappings
- **Multipath I/O setups** - Weight extent mapping now idempotent
- **Service stability** - Eliminates pvestatd crashes from duplicate mapping attempts

### ⚠️ **Deployment Notes**
- Update is backward compatible with existing configurations
- No manual cleanup required for existing mappings
- Recommended for all installations, especially those using shared TrueNAS systems

## Version 1.0.6 (October 11, 2025)

### 🚀 **Performance Improvements**
- **Optimized device discovery** - Progressive backoff strategy for faster iSCSI device detection
  - **Device discovery time: 10s → <1s** (typically finds device on first attempt)
  - Previously: Fixed 500ms intervals between checks, up to 10 seconds maximum wait
  - Now: Progressive delays (0ms, 100ms, 250ms) with immediate first check
  - More aggressive initial checks catch fast-responding devices immediately
  - Rescan frequency increased from every 2.5s (5 attempts) to every 1s (4 attempts)
  - Maximum wait time reduced from 10 seconds to 5 seconds
  - Real-world testing shows devices discovered on attempt 1 in typical scenarios

- **Faster disk deletion** - Reduced iSCSI logout wait times
  - **Per-deletion time savings: 2-4 seconds**
  - Logout settlement wait reduced from 2s to 1s (2 occurrences in deletion path)
  - Modern systems with faster udev settle times benefit immediately
  - Affects both extent deletion retry (line 2342) and dataset busy retry (line 2432)

### 🔧 **Technical Details**
- Modified device discovery loop in `alloc_image()` (lines 2154-2179)
  - Implements progressive backoff: immediate check → 100ms → 250ms intervals
  - First 3 attempts complete in 350ms instead of 1.5s
  - Rescans every 4 attempts (1s intervals) instead of every 5 attempts (2.5s intervals)
  - Attempt logging shows discovery speed for diagnostics
- Updated logout wait times in `free_image()` (lines 2342, 2432)
  - Reduced sleep(2) to sleep(1) in both extent deletion retry and dataset busy retry paths
  - Modern systems complete iSCSI logout and udev settlement faster than previous 2s assumption

### 📊 **Performance Impact**
- **Device discovery component**: 10s maximum → <1s typical (90%+ improvement)
- **Deletion operations**: 2-4s faster per operation
- **Best case**: Device appears immediately on first check (0ms wait vs 500ms minimum before)
- **Typical case**: Device discovered on attempt 1 within 100ms (was 2-3s on average)
- **Worst case**: Still bounded at 5 seconds maximum (was 10 seconds)

### ⚠️ **Important Notes**
- **Total allocation time** remains 7-8 seconds due to TrueNAS API operations (zvol creation ~2-3s, extent creation ~1-2s, LUN mapping ~1-2s, iSCSI login ~2s if needed)
- **Device discovery** is now effectively instant (attempt 1), removing what was previously a 2-10 second bottleneck
- **Further optimization** would require changes to TrueNAS API response times, which are outside plugin control

## Version 1.0.5 (October 10, 2025)

### 🐛 **Bug Fixes**
- **Fixed VMID filter in list_images** - Weight zvol and other non-VM volumes now properly excluded from VMID-specific queries
  - Previously: Volumes without VM naming pattern (e.g., pve-plugin-weight) appeared in ALL VMID filters
  - Root cause: Filter only checked `defined $owner` but skipped volumes where owner couldn't be determined
  - Now: When VMID filter is specified, skip volumes without detectable owner OR with non-matching owner
  - Impact: `pvesm list storage --vmid X` now only shows volumes belonging to VM X
  - Prevents test scripts and tools from accidentally operating on weight zvol

### 🔧 **Technical Details**
- Modified `list_images()` function (lines 2558-2562)
- Changed filter logic from `if (defined $vmid && defined $owner && $owner != $vmid)`
- To: `if (defined $vmid) { next MAPPING if !defined $owner || $owner != $vmid; }`
- Ensures volumes without vm-X-disk naming pattern are excluded when filtering by VMID

---

## Version 1.0.2 (October 7, 2025)

### 🐛 **Bug Fixes**
- **Fixed pre-flight check size calculation** - Corrected `_preflight_check_alloc` to treat size parameter as bytes instead of KiB, eliminating false "insufficient space" errors

### ✅ **Verification**
- **Confirmed all pre-flight checks working correctly**:
  - Space validation with 20% overhead calculation
  - API connectivity verification
  - iSCSI service status check
  - iSCSI target verification with detailed error messages
  - Parent dataset existence validation
- **Verified disk allocation accuracy** - 10GB disk request creates exactly 10,737,418,240 bytes on TrueNAS

---

## Version 1.0.1 (October 6, 2025)

### 🐛 **Bug Fixes**
- **Fixed syslog errors** - Changed all `syslog('error')` calls to `syslog('err')` (correct Perl Sys::Syslog priority)
- **Fixed syslog initialization** - Moved `openlog()` to BEGIN block for compile-time initialization
- **Fixed Perl taint mode security violations** - Added regex validation with capture groups to untaint device paths
- **Fixed race condition in volume deletion** - Added 2-second delay and `udevadm settle` after iSCSI logout
- **Fixed volume size calculation** - Corrected byte/KiB confusion in `_preflight_check_alloc` and `alloc_image`

### ⚠️ **Known Issues**
- **VM cloning size mismatch** - Clone operations fail due to size unit mismatch between `volume_size_info` and Proxmox expectations (investigation ongoing)

---

## Version 1.0.0 - Configuration Validation, Pre-flight Checks & Space Validation (October 5, 2025)

### 🔒 **Configuration Validation at Storage Creation**
- **Required field validation** - Ensures `api_host`, `api_key`, `dataset`, `target_iqn` are present
